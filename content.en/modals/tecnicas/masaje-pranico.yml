  Prana is the energy of the environment, of the universe, to which we are connected, and with which we can interact with it consciously through attention to the breath.

  This massage invites conscious breathing during the session.

  It is a valuable tool to mobilize memories stored in the body, which the therapist activates through specific techniques performed.
