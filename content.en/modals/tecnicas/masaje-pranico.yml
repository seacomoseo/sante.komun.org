description: |
  Prana is the energy of the environment, of the universe, to which we are connected, and with which we can interact consciously by putting attention to the breath.

  This massage invites conscious breathing during the session.

  It is a valuable tool that can help trigger memories stored in the body, which the therapist activates through specific techniques performed.
