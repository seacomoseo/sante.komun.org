  PNI recognizes the connection between mental processes and physical health.

  Cognitive factors, such as stress, emotions and beliefs, can influence the functioning of the body's organ systems.

  PNI involves active listening, relating signs and symptoms to discover the origins of imbalance in the body, resulting in an individual and holistic approach to health.
