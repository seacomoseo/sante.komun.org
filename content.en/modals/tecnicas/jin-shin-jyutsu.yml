  The ancient Japanese art of Jin Shin Jyutsu is based on the idea that our being is crossed by energy circuits, sometimes blocked for emotional, physical and/or mental reasons.

  By placing the hands on certain areas of the body, the free flow of energy is stimulated. Through these channels it helps to reduce tension, facilitating self-healing.

  After a Jin Shin Jyutsu session we feel harmonious and rested.
