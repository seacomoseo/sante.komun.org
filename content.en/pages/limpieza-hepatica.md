## Introduction

The liver is a vital organ responsible for multiple metabolic functions, including the detoxification of harmful substances, protein synthesis, and lipid metabolism. A liver cleanse is a therapeutic procedure designed to optimize its function, promote the elimination of accumulated toxins, and stimulate cellular regeneration.

## Procedure Objectives

1. **Facilitate biliary excretion:** Stimulate bile flow to improve fat digestion and waste elimination.

2. **Reduce toxic load:** Favor the purification of hepatotoxic metabolites (such as ammonia, alcohol, and medications).

3. **Strengthen hepatocellular function:** Provide essential nutrients (e.g., antioxidants, amino acids) to support hepatic parenchyma repair.

## Physiological Foundations

- **Critical osmolarity:** Saline concentration prevents intestinal water absorption through osmotic gradient, directing liquid toward the colon for sediment removal (*washing effect*).

- **Temperature:** Warm water (‚âà40¬∞C) enhances *decrustation* of residues adhered to the intestinal mucosa and stimulates motility.

- **Alternatives:** In cases of salt intolerance, substitute with **hypotonic vegetable broth** (carrot, leek, celery), although with lower efficacy in luminal retention.

## PHASE 1: Saline Solution Preparation

### Preparation
- Prepare **2-3 liters of warm salt water** (1 tablespoon of salt per liter).
- **Important**: The water **must** be salted to prevent absorption by the mucosa (by osmosis).
- Boil the water, let it cool slightly and dissolve the salt. You can drink it **warm**.

### Alternative for salt intolerance
- Replace salt water with **homemade vegetable broth** (carrot, leek, etc.).

### Step-by-step instructions

1. **Drink a glass of warm water** and **immediately** perform the first series of movements (indicated below).

2. **Repeat**:
   - Drink another glass.
   - Do another series of movements.

3. **Continue** until drinking **6 glasses total**, until the urge to go to the bathroom appears.
   - **First evacuation**: Usually quick, with increasingly liquid stools (yellowish color).
   - If you don't evacuate in **5 minutes**, repeat the movements **without drinking more water** until the urge to go to the bathroom appears.

4. **Subsequent process**:
   - Alternate: **drink ‚Üí exercises ‚Üí bathroom** until the water comes out **as clean as it went in**.
   - Normally **10-14 glasses** are needed (rarely more).

5. **Completion**:
   - Stop when you are satisfied with the result.
   - **Note**: You will continue evacuating liquids in the following hour.

### Complementary exercises

To facilitate water movement through the intestine, perform these exercises:

**Recommendation**: Follow the instructions patiently and adjust salt concentration according to your tolerance.

## üåø PHASE 2: Raw Vegan Diet + Professional Hydrotherapy (7 Days)

### Objectives
- Alkalize the organism.
- Provide **malic acid** in the mornings mixed in water or green juice (Food supplement) to dissolve gallstones.
- Colon hydrotherapy to facilitate the passage of gallstones.

### üìù Daily Plan

#### 1. Morning Green Juice (on empty stomach)

**Create your Recipes:**
- `A` 1 cucumber + 1 bunch of spinach + ¬Ω lemon + 1 tbsp liquid chlorophyll + 1 green apple.

- `D` Celery + Parsley + ¬Ω Lemon + ¬Ω Apple + Ginger + Kvass (Fermented beet)

#### 2. 1.5 kg of apples (malic acid)
- Consume at any time of the day.

#### 3. Colon hydrotherapy
- Perform **minimum 3 sessions during Phase 2**.
- Note: Hydrotherapy can be performed at a specialized center or at home with specific deep cleansing materials (Evacuation table, water reservoir, and anal cannula).

#### 4. üçΩÔ∏è Raw Vegan Recipes
**Recommended to eat when hungry:**

- **Breakfast:** Chia pudding + almond milk + red berries.
- **Lunch:** Zucchini zoodles (spiralized) with raw pesto (basil, garlic, pine nuts).

D. Beet tartare with walnuts.

### Home colon hydrotherapy protocol

1. Prepare 20L of boiled warm water (37-39¬∞C)
2. Use hydrotherapy equipment following manufacturer's instructions
3. Perform in comfortable position on evacuation table
4. Alternate water entry with abdominal massages
5. Repeat until achieving clear water output

## PHASE 3: Final Liver Drainage (Day 9-10)

### Objective
Massive expulsion of gallstones and deep detoxification.

### Protocol

#### 1. Epsom Salts (Magnesium Sulfate)
- **Dose:** 1 tablespoon in 250 ml of water.
- **Schedule:**
  - **6:00 PM** -- First dose.
  - **8:00 PM** -- Second dose.
  - **9:00 PM**
  - **6:00 AM** (next day) -- Third dose.
  - **8:00 AM** -- Fourth dose.
- **Function:** Activates gallbladder, dilates bile ducts, and relaxes the sphincter of Oddi.

#### 2. Oil + Grapefruit Mixture (9:00 PM) 1h after second dose
- **Proportion:** ‚Öì extra virgin olive oil + ‚Öî fresh grapefruit juice (squeezed).
- **Quantity:** 200 ml total (75 ml oil + 125 ml grapefruit).
